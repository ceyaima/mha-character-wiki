    <h2>Appearance:</h2>
    <div class = "p">
      <p>
      Shoto is a reasonably tall and rather muscular young man who is well-built for his age. He has quite long hair, though it doesn't pass his neck, and wears bangs, parted twice as to not obscure his vision. His hair is evenly split between two colors: white on his right side and crimson red on his left, this unusual coloring being due to his Quirk. As another result of this, he also possesses heterochromia iridium, which causes his left eye's iris to appear turquoise, while his right is a brownish dark gray. His eyes, in shape, are quite thin and reserved. Additionally, he has a large burn scar on the left side of his face, which reaches from his hairline to halfway down his cheek. He usually has a serious expression. Despite this, however, several of the girls in his class have claimed that he is handsome and Mina Ashido even goes as far as to say that he's the best-looking guy in Class 1-A.
      </p>

      <p>
      During school hours, he wears the regular male U.A. uniform, replacing the usual brown dress shoe with casual pale cyan and gray lace-up sneakers.
      </p>

      <p>
      In his initial hero costume, he wears a plain off-white shirt with matching pants and boots, with two gold-colored straps going over his shoulders. He has what appears to be a material resembling ice covering his whole left side, even his head, although it is detachable, which he wears as a way of rejecting the fire aspect of his Quirk.
      </p>

      <p>
      His updated hero costume consists of a dark blue jacket with elbow-length sleeves, its collar high and joined in the center by a gray neckpiece, baggy pants of the same color, a metal-plated combat vest and white boots, their soles and a thin line running down the center of each of them a darker pale gray. He also sports a brown utility belt around his waist, with little metal capsules containing medical supplies hanging off the front.
      </p>

      <p>
      Later, in the Provisional Hero License Exam Arc, his costume gains two burgundy wrist guards with metal plating, which help to regulate the temperature of his body after his attacks, and his boots now have a set of straps.
      </p>

      <p>
      Sometime during Spring Break, Shoto further upgrades his costume, which has some visual similarities to his father's second costume. His wrist guards now feature armor-like bracing and are accompanied by plating going from his wrist to his knuckles. His jacket now features a large grey-blue T-shaped stripe going from his waist to his armpits, and his utility belt now holds two large canisters along with his medical supplies. His costume is also a darker shade of blue than his earlier costumes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Personality:</h2>
    <div class = "p">
      <p>
      Shoto originally had a cold, aloof personality, which stemmed from his abusive upbringing and complicated family life. Focused and unemotional, Shoto preferred to keep to himself instead of hanging out with other people. After the events of the U.A. Sports Festival, however, Shoto notably became more sociable and kind, even gaining a sense of humor and occasionally smiling, although still retaining some fragments of his previous distant attitude. After the Provisional Hero License Course, he began opening up more to his classmates and has lightened up from his usually serious demeanor. Nonetheless, Shoto is not quite used to socializing yet, coming off as a bit dense when it comes to understanding certain phrases and figures of speech.
      </p>

      <p>
      While usually quiet and reserved, Shoto did initially possess a moderate level of arrogance, which, combined with his solitary tendencies, sometimes made him take the initiative without considering the opinions of others, displaying confidence that he could take on any obstacles with his own strength. He used to be much more unfriendly as well, to the point of causing Inasa Yoarashi to resent him while he was none the wiser. Even in the present, Shoto seems to prefer acting alone, although only for practical purposes since doing so allows him to unleash his full power without having to worry about friendly fire. Calm and composed, yet brutal in combat, Shoto is well-grounded on the ethics of heroism, only wishing to subdue his frozen opponents as opposed to killing them by prolonging the freezing.
      </p>

      <p>
      Shoto had a deep loathing for his fire abilities, which he inherited from Endeavor, as it symbolized his father's wickedness towards him and his mother as well as what he was born to be: a tool to surpass All Might, a fate that he detested. As such, Shoto decided to rely solely on his freezing power and never use the other half of his Quirk in battles, going so far as to cover his left torso and arm with ice in his first Hero Costume to symbolize his rebellion against his father. Shoto often felt bothered by Endeavor's mere presence, and could barely contain his anger while talking to him, especially whenever the Pro Hero brought up the purpose he had intended for his son since before birth.
      </p>

      <p>
      During his match with Izuku Midoriya in the U.A. Sports Festival, Izuku's speech made the memory of his mother's supportive words resurface, and for the first time since his childhood, Shoto used his firepower in combat. After the battle, Shoto had mixed feelings about using his left side, but after reconciling with his mother, Shoto eventually came to terms with the half he once hated and became willing to train it further. Despite being scarred by her when he was a young child, Shoto shows no hate or disliking towards his mother, visiting her often ever since the end of the Sports Festival. Shoto draws his heroic values from All Might, a trait he shares with Izuku and Katsuki Bakugo, having fond memories of watching the Symbol of Peace on television together with Rei.
      </p>

      <p>
      However, Shoto's grudge towards Endeavor has not yet disappeared, even if he respects his father's ability as a Hero, self-admitting that such resentment can't vanish so easily and that he was wrong in trying to bury it. Having been denied a normal childhood so that his father could train him to realize his own selfish ambitions, Shoto still holds various psychological scars, which tend to reemerge when others compare him to Endeavor. Because of this and Izuku's influence, Shoto now strives to become a Hero, but without walking the same path his father did.
      </p>

      <p>
      Shoto remains relatively cold towards Endeavor and has made it clear that forgiveness for his past treatment of him and his mother is difficult, but has demonstrated worry pertaining to his father's safety. Ever since Endeavor tried to repair his relationship with his family, Shoto has taken a cautious, yet hopeful approach to the development.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Abilities:</h2>
    <div class = "p">
      <p>
      <b>Overall Abilities:</b> Having been trained by his father, Endeavor, at a young age, Shoto entered U.A. High School through recommendations, and has been established as one of the strongest students in Class 1-A. He earned 2nd place in both the Quirk Apprehension Test and U.A. Sports Festival. Shoto also has a great handle over his versatile and powerful Quirk, Half-Cold Half-Hot, which grants him incredible dual-element capabilities. Using the right side of his body, Shoto can drastically lower temperatures and freeze anything he touches, and generate ice that he can freely mold into numerous constructs that include ice waves that cover large areas, and ice barriers. Shoto also employs his cryokinetic abilities for mobility purposes, such as stacking ice shards behind his back to propel himself forward, glaciating the ground to skate on it, or his signature move, creating trails of ice on which he can surf. From the left side of his body, Shoto can eloquently increase thermokinetics and release scorching hot flames in the form of consuming streams or protective waves. Overall, Shoto has tremendous power, but because of past decisions and circumstances, such as his intentional neglect of one half of his Quirk, he has yet to reach his full potential.
      </p>

      <p>
      At the U.S.J., Shoto was able to easily overpower small-time villains at the Landslide Zone by himself, and later on showcased elite judgment, combat awareness, and athletic ability during the U.A. Sports Festival. At the festival, Shoto was able to neutralize a Villain Bot-Executor, defeat his swift classmates, Hanta Sero and Tenya Ida, as well as fight on par with Izuku Midoriya for a prolonged period of time to a nigh-draw. In his battle against Izuku, a fan claimed that Shoto was already stronger than the average Pro Hero. When he was pitted against Katsuki Bakugo in the final round of the Sports Festival, there was a chance Shoto could've won the match using his fire powers, but due to inner turmoil, he extinguished his inferno, leaving him open to Katsuki's "Howitzer Impact", and losing the match. Starting with the Hosu Incident, Shoto began the full embracement of his left side, as well as his pyro-cryogenic interchangeability, particularly when he, Izuku, and Tenya faced off against the Hero Killer: Stain. Following his run-in with the Hero Killer, Shoto is recognized as one of strongest students of Class 1-A, as noted by Pixie-Bob.
      </p>

      <p>
      While Shoto may possess full supremacy over his cryomancy, the control over his pyrokinesis was initially relatively inept, especially in comparison to that of Endeavor. However, after the third match of the Joint Training Battle, Shoto realized that he had disregarded his left side for too long, which had put him and his team at a disadvantage, and resolved to achieve greater mastery over his pyrokinetic abilities by learning the fundamentals of "Flashfire Fist", Endeavor's signature technique. Thanks to his internship, Shoto's handling over his left side has improved significantly, as he can now use his pyromancy in a new variety of ways, such as boosting his movement speed, launching himself through the air, and attacking with blaze-powered punches. And though Shoto is powerful, contending with individuals such as Stain, Wolfram, Moonfish, Mr. Compress, Gang Orca, Chimera, and Tomura Shigaraki require Shoto's effective camaraderie with multiple people in order to prevail against such formidable opponents. That was hardly the case during the climax of the Paranormal Liberation War, wherein he faced his brother Dabi in a battle of flames that nearly resulted in Shoto being burned alive, had it not been for Izuku's brief intervention. As the body-charring Todoroki brothers resumed their full-power pyromantic clash, Shoto ended up losing, but Dabi chose to spare his brother, as it would've been pointless to kill him without Endeavor watching.
      </p>

      <p>
      During Class A's mission to bring Izuku back to U.A. after he left following the events of the war, Shoto displayed an even greater mastery over his cryokinetic abilities. In particular, his control over the shape of his ice has become much more refined, being able to form a massive vertical pillar of ice with Heaven-Piercing Ice Wall, and even being able to create a smooth curved ramp without the need of a solid framework. Furthermore, he's shown the ability to use his signature move, Flashfreeze Heatwave, without needing to cool the air down first; now he can simply put his hands together and unleash the power of both sides at once to create the same effect.
      </p>

      <ul>
      <li><b>Enhanced Durability:</b> Shoto has proven himself to be quite resilient, being able to withstand multiple attacks from Izuku, including a direct, One For All-enhanced punch at 5% strength to the stomach, without sustaining major injuries. During his fight with Leviathan, Shoto was able to withstand his punch, which was strong enough to destroy the floor of the Humanise headquarters. One of the most impressive examples of Shoto's resilience, was when he endured the superior agnikinesis of Dabi, although, Shoto was partially shielded by his own agnimancy, and Dabi intentionally held back in his final attack that left Shoto alive.</li>

      <li><b>Enhanced Stamina:</b> Shoto has shown to be able to endure combat even while injured. For example, in his battle with Stain, he was able to continue fighting and supporting his allies despite suffering from multiple bleeding injuries on his arm and face, and was still able to drag the villain's unconscious body once the battle is over. When he engaged Dabi in an agnikinetic brawl, Shoto continued to fight on despite his body slowly becoming charred.</li>

      <li><b>Enhanced Agility:</b> Shoto is fast, agile, and has quick reflexes. He was able to keep first place during the majority of the Obstacle Race during the Sports Festival thanks to his own athletic ability. He repeatedly created ice walls within a split second in order to prevent himself from getting thrown out of the ring through his matchups with Izuku and Katsuki. He was the only one in Class 1-A capable of at least partly reacting to and dodging Tenya's Recipro Turbo. He was also able to partially dodge a knife thrown at his face and several other attacks by Stain, a notably swift opponent.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      <b>Keen Intellect:</b> Shoto has proven to be a very intelligent person. And in spite of his training, Shoto is also very skilled in academics, having scored 5th place in the midterms. During the U.S.J. Incident, Shoto accurately extrapolated that the invading villains had a Quirk user amongst their ranks that could jam communications. At the same time, he realized the attacking villains had an agenda and interrogated some of them to get answers. Shoto's theory was proven correct as the villain's goal was to kill All Might. Shoto also deduced Izuku had a connection to All Might after observing Izuku's power and matching it to that of All Might when the latter was fighting Nomu. Though on point about Izuku's link to the Symbol of Peace, Shoto incorrectly believed Izuku might be All Might's secret love child. Shortly before the Hosu Incident, Shoto noticed the look of anger in Tenya's eyes, and easily surmised that he was only taking up an internship in Hosu City to seek vengeance on the Hero Killer: Stain. While on patrol in Hosu, Shoto was able to work out the location of Izuku, Tenya, and Stain from an emergency call and arrive in time, however he did complain it took a while, as Izuku didn't relay more than the exact location.
      </p>

      <p>
      When he and Momo Yaoyorozu were paired together to face Eraser Head for their First Term Final Exam, Shoto suggested that Momo continuously creates random objects until she was unable to do so, which would signify that the Eraser Hero is nearby, all in attempt to lure him out and act as a diversion so Momo can make her way to the escape gate. Shoto's strategy worked, but as explained by Eraser Head, it was too offense-oriented, as Shoto had placed the burden on himself and did not trust Momo enough. After being scolded by his teacher and approached by his returning classmate, Shoto admitted to being aware of Momo having a plan from the start of their matchup and not to inquiring about it, before properly cooperating with her. Observing the second match of the Joint Training Battle involving the teams of Momo and Itsuka Kendo, Shoto noticed a flaw in Itsuka's precautionary modus operandi in separating Momo from her Class 1-A teammates. He elucidated that if she really wanted to be cautious of Momo, then Itsuka would've had her entire team overwhelm the Everything Hero at the beginning of the match. After witnessing Izuku's awakening of a second Quirk, Shoto speculated that the One For All inheritor may be like him, having multiple powers in one singular ability, but Shoto didn't yet recognize the true depth of Izuku's new power.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Indomitable Will:</b> Shoto has a highly undaunted spirit, not easily giving in to intimidation that would disrupt his focus, maintaining a cool head, and pushes through adversity. Initially, Shoto was a jaded and aloof person due to the abuse he and his family received from Endeavor's previous callousness, resulting in Shoto refusing to use his left side in battles as a sign of rejecting his father. Once the U.A. Sports Festival was underway, Shoto was considerably hellbent on not using his fire powers, but this misguided determination was corrected when he faced Izuku, who vehemently expressed that those powers belong to Shoto, nobody else. This triggered a latent memory within Shoto's psyche, as he recalled how his mother, Rei Todoroki, and All Might said those same words that inspired Shoto to be a hero that can put people at ease with a smile, just like All Might himself. Remembering both these passionate words and his resolve, Shoto was free from the turmoil that stirred inside of him, finally used the power housed within his left side, and expressed how he, like Izuku, will be a hero and was grateful to Izuku for saving him from the emotional shackles that were weighing him down.
      </p>

      <p>
      Unfortunately, afterward, despite willingly using the power of his left side, Shoto still had some level of uncertainty. While battling Katsuki, Shoto, as Eraser Head explicated, lost his spark following his previous match with Izuku, causing him to not give 100% of his strength. As Shoto was becoming paralyzed with doubt, Izuku cheered him on, encouraging him to do his best, once again reigniting Shoto's will to fight and use his ignikinesis. Yet at the last second, before clashing with Katsuki, Shoto's inner turmoil was too prevalent, causing him to extinguish his conflagration, and in turn, lose the battle against Katsuki. Following the Sports Festival, Shoto has fortified his drive, becoming more than willing to use his agnimantic abilities in battle, and even having the courage to finally face his mother, Rei, who previously, albeit in a mentally unstable state, gave Shoto the scar over his left eye.
      </p>

      <p>
      When the Provisional License Exam occurred, Shoto's will was tested again when he had a major altercation with Inasa Yoarashi, having coldly rebuffing the aerokinetic's warm personality when the two met at the U.A. Recommendation Entrance Exam for recommended students. Shoto realized that he still hasn't moved past Endeavor's maltreatment, and his horrid attitude led to Inasa developing his own hateful disposition towards Shoto himself. The infighting between the two elemental users resulted in them being repeatedly unable to land an attack on Gang Orca and were left at the mercy of him and his sidekicks. Soon after, however, Izuku arrived on the scene and scolded Shoto and Inasa for their actions, making the weakened students realize their mistake of being uncooperative with one another. The pair reaffirmed their convictions, put their differences aside, and finally worked together, despite being incapacitated. Unfortunately, their personal conflict with each other cost them the licensing exam and had to take remedial courses to make up for their imprudence and failure. Having undergone self-reflection, Shoto and Inasa displayed fully mutual congeniality towards each other when they crossed paths again at the Remedial Exam.
      </p>

      <p>
      During the third match of the Joint Training Battle, Shoto was pressured by Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu, but was able to recall Endeavor's counsel on bringing his inferno to the limit, and then surpassing that very apex. This advice proved pivotal, as Shoto, also recollecting Izuku's words of encouragement, understood that if he wants to become the hero he desires to be, he has to go beyond what his body and Quirk are capable of doing. His will sparked again, Shoto brought his phlegokinesis to the limit, equaling the potency of Endeavor's own flames, and was able to better hold his own against Tetsutetsu and put latter's metal skin at risk of melting. In the climax of the Paranormal Liberation War, Shoto's spirit took a significant blow when Dabi revealed his true identity as Toya Todoroki, Shoto's eldest sibling who was thought to have been deceased. Discovering that Toya was alive for years, became a villain, and orchestrated the recent encounters with Hood, Starservant, and Ending, Shoto was sent into a tearful rage. In spite of these revelations, Shoto remained steadfast and was more than willing to engage his corrupted brother, not wavering when the Todoroki brothers clashed, despite Toya's superior abilities.
      </p>


      <h4>Quirk</h4>
      <p>
      <b>Half-Cold Half-Hot (半冷半燃 - はんれいはんねん Hanrei Han'nen):</b> Shoto's Quirk gives him the ability to generate ice from the right side of his body, and flames from his left side.
      </p>

      <p>
      Due to years of rejecting his father, Shoto has developed a habit of favoring ice, even when fire would be a better option. This grudge also caused him to have difficulty controlling his flames. While he is capable of using both elements simultaneously, he isn't used to doing this and still needs to practice dual-wielding. While training for his ultimate move, he claimed that using both abilities at the same time slows him down.
      </p>

      <p>
      If he overuses one element without utilizing the other, then his own body temperature will suffer; the ice half will cause frostbite and the fire half will cause heatstroke. Until his bodily limit is reached, however, neither has any visible effect on his body. Shoto can easily negate this weakness by alternating between ice and fire.
      </p>

      <p>
      As part of his training, Shoto sat in a barrel of water and alternated between using ice and fire to regulate the temperature of the water. It helped his body become accustomed to the cold, and he learned better control over his flames.
      </p>


      <h4>Super Moves</h4>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Heaven-Piercing Ice Wall (穿天氷壁 - がてんひょうへき Gaten Hyōheki):</b> Shoto creates an enormous ice glacier, that can either encapsulate his opponent or block the immediate field of battle in ice. This move is first used in his battle against Hanta Sero in the Sports Festival, but is unnamed until the Final Exams. He noted to Hanta that it was more powerful than necessary, but he was irritated (from talking with Endeavor) and overdid it. A variation of this move, slightly smaller in size, but more controllable, is shown in his battle against Katsuki. He also used this attack repeatedly on a massive scale while attacking Mr. Compress.</li>
      <li><b>Wall of Flames (炎の壁 - ほのおのかべ Honō no Kabe):</b> Shoto uses his left side to generate a burst of flames that covers a large area. This is both a defensive and offensive attack like his Giant Ice Wall technique. It can be used to attack multiple opponents and create space between Shoto and his target. Shoto first used this attack against Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu during the Joint Training Battle with Class 1-B.</li>
      <li><B>Flashfreeze Heatwave (膨冷熱波 - ぼうれいねっぱ Bōrei Neppa):</b> To use this technique, first Shoto cools the air around him with his ice powers. Then, by switching to his fire, Shoto rapidly heats and expands the air around him. This allows him to release a superheated blast. He first used this attack against Izuku Midoriya at the climax of their match in the Sports Festival.</li>
      <li><b>Flashfire Fist (赫灼熱拳 - かくしゃくねっけん Kaku Shakunekken):</b> Endeavor's signature technique, later passed down to Shoto himself. The user increases the temperature of their flames to their maximum and compresses them to a white-hot point, maximizing their power.</li>
      <li><b>Jet Kindling (赫灼熱拳噴流熾炎 - かくしゃくねっけんふんりゅうしえん Kaku Shakunekken Funryūshien):</b> Shoto concentrates his flames into a white-hot point on his fist and punches his opponent. On contact, a violent explosion of flames burst out of Shoto's arm, severely burning his target. He first uses this attack against Leviathan in the final battle against Humarise.</li>
      </ul>
