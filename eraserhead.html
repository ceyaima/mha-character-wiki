    <h2>Appearance:</h2>
    <div class = "p">
      <p>
        Shota is a slender and tall, pale-skinned man with messy, shoulder-length black hair that partially hangs in front of his face and often half-opened black eyes. He is usually recognized for his worn-out appearance,often looking fatigued. His facial hair is almost always in a stubbly, unkempt state (unless he needs to look good for the press), and his eyes tired and flat unless he is in combat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shota sports a baggy black outfit that consists of a long-sleeved shirt and matching pants that tuck into his boots. He also wears a utility belt and his signature wrap scarf at all times. He hides a pair of bright yellow goggles underneath his scarf for when he needs to use them in battle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before starting his teaching career, Shota's goggles were of a silver-like color, and he had a smaller utility belt.
      </p>

      <p>
        During his second and third years of high school at U.A., Shota's hero outfit was a separate black jacket and pants, as opposed to his current outfit, which looks more like a unitard. He also sported a pair of fingerless gloves. In his second year, Shota added goggles to his costume. His goggles in his third year resemble more closely the ones he wears today.
      </p>

      <p>
        After being heavily injured by Nomu, Shota's entire face and both of his arms were completely covered in bandages. Once these bandages were removed, Shota reveals a deep scar underneath his right eye.
      </p>

      <p>
        His formal attire for press meetings and meetings with parents of his students includes a black suit, blue tie, and white dress shirt. While in this attire, his hair is well-groomed and held back in a low bun at the base of his neck.
      </p>

      <p>
        In his downtime or when he's relaxing in his staff apartment, Shota wears a loose black shirt with long sleeves and wears his hair in a messy bun.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the fight against Tomura Shigaraki, Shota had to cut his right leg off to prevent the Quirk-Destroying Drug from destroying his Quirk. In the aftermath of the battle, Shota now has a second scar on his eye stretching from his eyebrow to his lower eyelid, as well an eyepatch covering his right eye entirely, due to the damage received from Tomura. He also now possesses a prosthetic right leg.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Personality:</h2>
    <div class = "p">
      <p>
        Shota is a very stern and reserved man who has lofty expectations of his students. He is primarily motivated by logic and does not believe in the necessity to maintain a clean-cut appearance or filter his words or ideas for others. He often comes off as cold, apathetic, and impatient, exerting very little energy in most situations, preferring to take naps in his sleeping bag instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a teacher with notoriously high expectations, Shota is known to expel students who he feels are not suited for U.A. High. However, it's revealed that this high expulsion rate is only on paper and that he actually re-enrolls the students he expels: Shota does this so they can experience "death" once, giving them an experience that drives them to push even higher. Although it is noteworthy that he has not expelled any students from Class 1-A yet despite being well-known for doing so. He can be rigid and strict when necessary and has little tolerance for disobedient behavior. Shota is not afraid of putting his students through rigorous training and often pushes the more unpleasant parts of Heroism so that his students can overcome their limits.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shota has proven to be very vocal and unafraid when expressing his ideas. He has mentioned on several occasions that some of U.A.'s choices when it comes to examinations are not practical or challenging enough for real Hero hopefuls and is adamant about having certain systems used by the institution changed. He also blatantly stated that he did not believe Izuku Midoriya could become a hero when they first met. He is also known for lying to his students in order to manipulate them into giving their best, a technique he describes as a 'logical ruse'/'rational deception'.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite his apathetic traits, Shota genuinely cares about his students and will go to great lengths to protect them as he saved Tsuyu Asui from Tomura Shigaraki, in spite of his grievous injuries. He has also expressed belief in his students on multiple occasions and is confident that even the likes of Katsuki Bakugo would not be swayed by villains. Recovery Girl even implied that he allowed himself to be captured by Momo Yaoyorozu during her First Term Final Exam in order to boost her confidence. Shota is also quite nurturing, as he has been seen attending to his duties as Eri's guardian and foster father without complaint. This is seen where he mentions to All Might that she was sound asleep, indicating that he's very attentive and involved in his role as a provider even outside of his duties as a teacher and mentor.
      </p>

      <p>
        He is shown to be extremely disturbed upon discovering the ultimate fate of his friend Oboro Shirakumo. He displayed intense grief upon confronting Kurogiri after discovering that he was once Oboro, showing that Shota has not yet come to terms with his friend's fate. Furthered by this tragedy, Shota is shown to be particularly wrathful towards individuals who are unfortunate enough to provoke him, especially by harming those he cares about. This was seen when Shota strangled Kyudai Garaki after learning of the desecration of Oboro's corpse, blocking Kyudai's longevity Quirk, tormenting and humiliating the aged scientist in a show of sheer rage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite his personality, Shota has shown on several occasions that he is not completely devoid of joy or humor: he often grins whenever he is impressed by one of his students or after he tricks them with one of his 'rational deceptions'.

    <h2>Abilities:</h2>
    <div class = "p">
      <p>
        <b>Overall Abilities:</b> Eraser Head has demonstrated incredible combat prowess and ingenuity that makes him one of the most formidable teachers and Pro Heroes at U.A. High. Eraser Head's usual battle tactic consists of canceling an opponent's Quirk and then using his Capturing Weapon in conjunction with his high agility to easily defeat or restrain his adversaries. Even without the aid of his Quirk, Eraser Head relies on his proficiency in hand-to-hand combat, excelling in close quarters combat. His overall abilities make him a pivotal combatant in situations where his opponents rely solely on the use of their Quirks, and with Eraser Head creating openings by negating their powers in the midst of battle, he and his comrades are put into advantageous positions.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the U.S.J. Incident, he effectively held his own against low-tier members of the League of Villains, that surrounded and outnumbered the Erasure Hero, dozens to one. Eraser Head evaded multiple attacks from opponents of various sizes and abilities before restraining them and sending them flying with calculated counter attacks. He was even able to nearly defeat Tomura Shigaraki, a highly capable villain before the Nomu intervened and overpowered the Erasure Hero. Other than Tomura, Eraser Head can effectively fend off high-level villains such as Vanguard Action Squad members, Dabi and Himiko Toga, albeit with some difficulty. He also played vital roles during the Shie Hassaikai Raid and the Paranormal Liberation War, both of which involved large teams of heroes contending with high-class villains, with the latter spectacle involving the suppression of various High-End Nomus and Tomura's enhanced abilities .
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Binding Cloth:</b> Shota developed a unique fighting style that involves his Capture weapon, by ensnaring and/or immobilizing his opponents, as well as using it for mobility such as swinging onto objects. As highly proficient he is at using this fighting style, Shota stated that it took him six years to develop it. This style of combat synchronizes well with his Erasure Quirk, as he can nullify the Quirks of his opponents while being to restrain and defeat them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Keen Intellect:</b> Eraser Head had been seen to have keen observation and evaluation skills. He can easily evaluate his student's personalities and their mental state. He is an expert on collaborating his equipment and Quirk with one another. In battle, Eraser Head uses goggles in conjunction with his Quirk to prevent enemies from figuring out who he's looking at, and keep them guessing. He also quickly creates strategies for dealing with different types of enemies, even those who are immune to his Quirk. In addition, he can meticulously discern the mechanics behind people’s abilities after witnessing them performed once.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Immense Stamina:</b> On multiple occasions, Eraser Head was able to keep fighting on even after suffering significant and painful injuries. During the U.S.J. Incident, despite his left arm and skull being shattered by the Nomu, he was still able to remain conscious long enough to save Tsuyu from being killed by Tomura. In addition, during the Paranormal Liberation Raid, Eraser Head was able to single-handedly amputate his leg fast enough to stop the effects of a Quirk-Destroying Bullet, with his Quirk never deactivating.
      </p>

      <h4>Quirk</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Erasure (抹消 - まっしょう Masshō):</b> Shota's Quirk gives him the ability to nullify another person's Quirk by looking at the user. The effects of this Quirk can still last even if Shota's line of vision is out of range.
      </p>
      <p>
        After sustaining grievous injuries at the U.S.J., Shota can't use his Quirk for as long and must rest longer between erasures.
      </p>
      <p>
        While powerful, this ability has many drawbacks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Erasure deactivates if Shota blinks.</li>
        <li>His Quirk gives Shota a bad dry eye, forcing him to blink more often when he uses the power continuously.</li>
        <li>Most Mutant-class Quirks are immune to Erasure.</li>
        <li>Erasure makes Shota's hair stand on end while it is active, allowing his enemies to see when his Quirk is active or not.</li>
        <li>This Quirk has no offensive potential.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
