    <h2>Appearance:</h2>
    <div class = "p">
      <p>
        Katsuki is a young man of average height, with a slim, muscular build, and a fair skin tone. He has short, spiky, sandy blonde hair with choppy bangs that hang over his eyebrows. His eyes are sharp and bright red in color.
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to the injuries he sustained during the Paranormal Liberation War Arc, Katsuki has two scars on his body. One on his left shoulder and one on his lower stomach area.
      </p>

      <p>
        At school, he wears the standard U.A. uniform without the customary red tie. Underneath his blazer, he wears a white collared shirt with the top few buttons undone. His pants are worn loosely, causing them to sag at his ankles, despite him wearing a belt with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        His hero costume is composed of a tight, black, sleeveless tank top, with an orange "X" across the middle, forming a v-neck. There are two dots along the left line of his collar, indicating the support company that designed his costume.[4] His costume also has a metallic neck brace worn with rectangular ends that have three holes on each side. His sleeves reach from within his large grenade-like gauntlets to his biceps. His belt, which also carries grenades, holds up his baggy pants with knee guards, below which he sports black, knee-high combat boots with orange soles and eyelets. His mask is jagged and black, and as it goes around his eyes, a large, orange-rimmed flare shape protrudes from each side.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the winter months, he wears a large jacket with a high collar, rather than the usual tank top, although it does have the same orange "X" design, so he can still sweat a sufficient amount, which is how his Quirk works.
      </p>

      <p>
        While interning under Best Jeanist, the Fiber Hero attempted to teach Katsuki the importance of maintaining a positive appearance. To that end, he took the liberty of making some changes to Katsuki outward appearance to make him look less intimidating. During this tenure, his wild spiky hair was combed into a neat side part. Best Jeanist also made changes to Katsuki's Hero costume; he got rid of Katsuki's mask and grenade gauntlets and had him wear a pair of smart blue denim jeans in place of his usual baggy pants.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Personality:</h2>
    <div class = "p">
      <p>
      Katsuki is a crude, arrogant, short-tempered, and aggressive person, especially at the beginning of the series. Katsuki tends to come off as unheroic, if not downright villainous for those not familiar with him. This problematic behavior goes all the way back to his early childhood days when he was known to bully a young, Quirkless, Izuku Midoriya. He shows hostility towards Izuku, mainly because of his former Quirkless status.
      </p>

      <p>
      However, after being accepted into U.A. and experiencing several personal defeats, one of them even coming from Izuku, Katsuki has gradually changed into a less antagonistic person, albeit still retaining a lot of his unpleasant traits. While often portrayed negatively, Katsuki's fierce character and competitive drive have actually granted him an important role among Class 1-A, as a sort of inspirational mood-maker.
      </p>

      <p>
      Determined and thirsty for victory, Katsuki smiles eerily when in the middle of a battle. He is incredibly focused on achieving his own authentic victories and has learned to never underestimate his opponents. Katsuki is not only very athletic and talented at fighting, but also very intelligent and extremely perceptive, capable of strategic planning and improvisation. Moreover, Katsuki's grades are among the highest of his class and he already knew how to read perfectly by age 4, evidence that he treats studying seriously. Katsuki also possesses surprising talent in other areas, such as cooking and music, even though he doesn't show a particular interest in them. Overall, Katsuki is considered a natural-born genius with the potential to be one of the best Pro Heroes around.
      </p>

      <p>
      While a rather volatile hero-in-training, Katsuki is smart enough to discern who his enemies and allies are. He is not particularly nice or open with people who are on his side, or anyone else for that matter, but will act less unfriendly and sometimes even kind to those that manage to earn his respect. Because of his attitude and vulgar language, Katsuki's U.A. classmates often react negatively to him, although they have come to appreciate his skills and warm up to his personality. Katsuki matures slowly through his time at U.A., coming to befriend some of his classmates and willingly engaging in social interaction with them, though remaining aloof and solitary for the most part.
      </p>

      <p>
      Katsuki tends to disregard the notion that Quirks shouldn't be used in public, and will activate his Quirk for a number of reasons, such as to intimidate someone, to punctuate a point, out of frustration, or even if he just feels like showing off. Overall, Katsuki doesn't seem to care very much about what others think of him, barely containing himself from violent behavior (although he avoids other typical delinquent practices like underage smoking). Katsuki values honesty highly and never lies, to the point his brash candor is seen by some as rude and insensitive. He is never afraid of speaking his mind and will notice when people are not being truthful to him. This shows that, despite his anti-social habits, Katsuki is an excellent judge of character, making it hard to deceive him.
      </p>

      <p>
      Due to the constant praise of his abilities and powerful Quirk, Katsuki has developed a superiority complex, and because of that, he desires to be the first and best at everything. As pointed out by many people, Katsuki loves to win above all else and cannot stand it when he doesn't, leading him to lose his already short temper or, less often, sulk. He is fiercely competitive and will never settle for less than the number one spot. However, Katsuki also values hard work and fair play, to the point of refusing to acknowledge a winning result if he feels that his victory was not earned by actual merit. Along with that, he detests being pitied or looked down by others, and will hold contempt towards those that don't take him seriously, while recognizing the effort of those that manage to put up a challenge against him, like, for example, Ochaco Uraraka and Eijiro Kirishima.
      </p>

      <p>
      Because of his Quirk and talents, Katsuki is very confident and brave to where he is willing to go against anyone who challenges him. He never backs down from a fight and will go out when facing such a powerful opponent. From taking on several villains at the Unforeseen Simulation Joint, Katsuki knows when dealing with someone that is out of his league, as he let All Might face off against Nomu. During the First Term Final Exam, Katsuki isn't afraid to go off against All Might.
      </p>

      <p>
      Katsuki is immensely prideful and prefers to act alone, as he hates the idea of being protected or having to rely on other people to assist him unless, in the latter's case, he is recognized as the unquestionable leading figure within a team. At the beginning of the series, Katsuki's cooperativeness was nothing short of atrocious, often ignoring his partners' ideas and suggestions for his own very direct approaches. His teamwork skills gradually improve as the series progresses, even if Katsuki keeps coming off as condescending through his usual tone. However, it's clear he now acknowledges their importance, protecting them from harm while expecting them to do the same for him in return. As a leader, Katsuki is a merciless perfectionist, and will only become satisfied with complete, indisputable victories.
      </p>

      <p>
      Katsuki often has difficulty accepting his mistakes and shortcomings, and will fiercely deny them whenever they are pointed out by others, regardless of who does it. That doesn't mean, however, that Katsuki doesn't listen to advice, having come to realize his faults and how to somewhat improve on them thanks to the words and actions of other people like All Might and Best Jeanist, but he will never outright admit due to his pride. He prefers to self-reflect in silence and solitude, becoming a bit more brooding during those periods. Katsuki's unchecked pride and aggression has cost him victories on numerous occasions, like the Battle Trial or the Provisional Hero License Exam, and it tends to worsen whenever Izuku is involved. Both characters share a sensitive history with each other, with Katsuki, in particular, being unable to completely overcome his issues with Izuku, although this has not stopped them from working together many times.
      </p>

      <p>
      Katsuki has a more vulnerable side, having been led to tears due to damaged pride a few times. After the Battle Trial, Katsuki admitted when he saw Shoto Todoroki's power, he couldn't beat in head on and called out how Momo Yaoyorozu is right about how he was reckless during his fight with Izuku. Katsuki has also shown moments of fear and guilt, the latter due to viewing himself and his own weakness as the cause of All Might losing his remaining power and retiring as a hero. Still, due to years of misunderstandings, tension, and pride, Katsuki has difficulty doing the same thing towards Izuku.
      </p>

      <p>
      Katsuki has also shown to be hypocritical at times. During the Remedial courses, he adviced a kid that if he continues to look down on others, he would not realize his mistakes. However, in the Joint Training Arc, he proceeds to call his teammates "underlings" and the former One For All Users "nobodies" because they did not have strong quirks.
      </p>

      <p>
      Katsuki also has a honorable side to him. While he didn't believe about Izuku's Quirk belonging to someone else's as well as falsely assuming Izuku been hiding it from him the entire time, when he learned of All For One and his Quirk he started to believe Izuku's words and pieced it together after seeing All Might's true form, he confronted the former about his assumption. After All Might confirmed his deduction, Katsuki vow to keep One For All a secret, being one of the few people to know about the true power of the Quirk.
      </p>

      <p>
      While his inspiration for becoming a hero was the same as Izuku's, the Symbol of Peace, All Might, their beliefs differ: Katsuki feels a hero should never stop fighting or give up, regardless of the threat they face, and that always winning is the mark of a true hero. Furthermore, various heroes, civilians, and even villains have commented on his arrogance and conceit. However, Katsuki is unwavering in his aspirations of heroism, having outright refused Tomura Shigaraki's proposal for him to join the League of Villains because he views the villains as people who lose and not win like heroes.
      </p>

      <p>
      It is later revealed that Katsuki helped Izuku train to atone for his actions during the Paranormal Liberation War. During Katsuki's discussion with All Might about his connections to Izuku, Katsuki admitted that he bullied Izuku as an outlet for his own insecurities and how he couldn't understand why Izuku would put others before himself. In truth, Katsuki really cares for Izuku despite how he acts, and wishes for him to continue improving his strength and Quirks, unlike before where he ridiculed Izuku's efforts and told him how he wouldn't amount to anything. His caring and protective side is further proven when he heard that Tomura was targeting One For All, immediately realizing that the villain leader would be going after Izuku and made attempts to keep Tomura away from him.
      </p>

      <p>
      After Izuku left U.A. in order to face All For One alone, as well as to protect his friends and family from danger, Katsuki, along with his classmates, departed in order to bring him back. Following a battle to get Izuku to come to his senses, Katsuki genuinely apologizes to the former for his actions while calling Izuku by his first name, displaying his regret over trying to usurp Izuku's strengths by putting him down and for bullying him in the past. This proves that Katsuki is repentant over his own faults, with him willing to face them in order to atone for his past actions, and now seeing Izuku as a true ally, friend and rival figure.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Abilities:</h2>
    <div class = "p">
      <p>
      <b>Overall Abilities:</b> Katsuki has proven to be one of the strongest students in Class 1-A, earning third place in the Quirk Apprehension Test, while placing first in both the U.A. Entrance Exam, having the most villain points, and the U.A. Sports Festival. Katsuki's fighting style is an all-out offense, using his Quirk's propulsive abilities to close the distance between him and his opponents, followed by a bombardment of close-range attacks that often start with a powerful right hook. Katsuki is able to use his Explosion to propel himself through mid-air, blind opponents, and release long-range blasts, among other applications. Explosion is a versatile Quirk, especially for battle situations, as the recoil caused by the blasts can be exploited by Katsuki for mobility purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
      During the U.S.J. Incident, Katsuki was able to single-handedly overpower and immobilize Kurogiri, a highly capable villain. At the U.A. Sports Festival, he was able to defeat Fumikage Tokoyami and Shoto Todoroki, who were considered the two other strongest students in Class 1-A at that point. Many notable Pro Heroes, such as Shota Aizawa and All Might, have praised Katsuki's prowess, noting the sheer amount of potential he carries. The League of Villains also took notice of Katsuki's strength and went as far as trying to kidnap him so he could be converted to their cause, even if it meant sacrificing members of the Vanguard Action Squad as his potential membership would have far exceeded the risk.
      </p>

      <p>
      Katsuki is strong enough to fight toe-to-toe and even overpower Izuku when he's using 5% of One For All. During the Joint Training Arc, Katsuki displayed that, despite the cold weather conditions of the winter season weakening his Quirk, he can still fight efficiently. Katsuki has also become slightly less insubordinate when paired with people and has developed a degree of camaraderie, as he utilizes his abilities to repel opponents that overpower his comrades.
      </p>

      <p>
      Not willing to let Izuku get ahead of him and never taking his intended goal of surpassing All Might lightly, Katsuki is always building up his power, improving his technique and looking forward to knowing what he is not able to do right now, with the intent of being able to do so in the future. Katsuki's unstoppable drive to win is perhaps his biggest strength, with all of his classmates, including Izuku, having faith in his ability to earn victories.
      </p>

      <p>
      By the time of the Paranormal Liberation Raid, Katsuki's overall abilities and proficiency have significantly increased, and he's even able to match the speed of Izuku using One For All at 30%.
      </p>

      <ul>
      <li><b>Enhanced Strength:</b> Katsuki possesses a high-caliber physical strength, confirmed by his ability to use his Grenade Bracers without sustaining effects from recoil, whereas Izuku nearly dislocated his arm trying to do so. He's also strong enough to casually pick up and throw people of Izuku's size considerable distance with one arm. His physical power is even enough to draw blood from Izuku at 5% of One For All with a kick.</li>
      <li><b>Enhanced Reflexes:</b> Perhaps Katsuki's greatest physical trait is his fantastic reflexes and reaction time. He's shown on several occasions overwhelming his foes with his speed or completely evading all their attacks while striking back such as in his battles with Ochaco, Cider House and Izuku (even when the latter was at 5% of One For All). His superb reflexes even allow him to evade a jet of carbonated water strong enough to cleave a street lamp in two. Typically jets of water that can cut through metal travel at 760 m/s (1700 mph) which is over twice the speed of sound. Even when suffering from multiple stab wounds he could temporarily hold his own against the Near High Ends with help from other heroes.</li>
      <li><b>Enhanced Durability:</b> Katsuki is shown to possess above average endurance and durability. He's tough enough to withstand the blowback of his explosions regularly with only moderate pain.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      <b>Keen Intellect:</b> Katsuki has proven to be extremely intelligent and strategic. While he occasionally doesn't have preemptive strategies like most people, he does analyze his opponent's weaknesses such as when he realized Fumikage's weakness to light during the U.A. Sports Festival in the midst of battle and can anticipate worst-case scenarios. Even when fighting the weaker villains during the Unforeseen Simulation Joint, Katsuki quickly assessed which of the attacking villains were the most dangerous threat in the long term and eventually figured out a way to incapacitate Kurogiri, one of the invasion's leaders. He also knew that Kurogiri had a weakness and bound his body to hinder his escape. By doing this, he effectively trapped the League of Villains in the U.S.J. until Nomu attacked. When being warned of a monster attack by Katsuma Shimano, he was quickly able to deduce that it was merely an illusion cast by Mahoro Shimano because it lacked a shadow.
      </p>

      <p>
      Even outside of battle, Katsuki is incredibly perceptive, having deducted the truth about One For All by just piecing together comments and interactions surrounding Izuku, All Might, and even All For One. Katsuki can seemingly detect when people are lying to him by just reading into their behaviors and expressions.
      </p>

      <p>
      Still, Katsuki's short temper gets the best on him sometimes, causing him to overlook crucial details and commit mistakes.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Leadership Skills:</b> Katsuki has always been criticized for his lack of cooperativeness, usually as a result of his overwhelming ego that prevents him from following the lead of others. However, thanks to Katsuki's very own determination, perfectionism, and intelligence, he is a capable leader should others decide to follow him instead. Though he may not realize it, Katsuki is one of the main motivators of Class 1-A alongside Izuku, thanks to his power and indomitable drive to win.
      </p>

      <p>
      During round four of the Joint Training Session, Setsuna Tokage admitted that even if her team had attacked him all at once, they stood no chance of victory. In the end, despite Class 1-B's exceptional teamwork and Setsuna's strategic planning, they failed to capture a single member of Class 1-A, mostly thanks to Katsuki's efforts, adaptability, and superior skills.
      </p>

      <p>
      Musical Talent: Katsuki is highly skilled at playing the drums, having gone through classes in the past.
      </p>

      <h4>Quirk</h4>
      <p>
      <b>Explosion (爆ばく破は Bakuha):</b> Katsuki's Quirk allows him to secrete nitroglycerin-like sweat from the palms of his hands and ignite it on command, allowing him to create strong explosions. The more Katsuki sweats, the stronger his explosions become. If Katsuki overuses this power, his forearms will start to ache.
      </p>

      <p>
      Katsuki has a strong grasp on the applications of his Quirk, something that was acknowledged by Best Jeanist, a top Pro Hero; not only can Katsuki use the explosions for attacking, he can also use them to propel himself and navigate through the air at high speeds, allowing him to fly at his opponents without giving them time to react, as well as evade incoming attacks, even while in the air. The shockwave from an explosion can even be used as a shield.
      </p>

      <p>
      Katsuki can keep up his explosions continuously, long enough to break through Eijiro's hardening Quirk and negate Shoto's "Heaven-Piercing Ice Wall" for a short while before being overwhelmed.
      </p>

      <p>
      As part of his training, Katsuki submerged his hands into boiling water to expand his sweat glands, then created chain explosions toward the sky to increase the scale of his attacks.
      </p>

      <h4>Temporary Quirk</h4>
      <p>
      <b>One For All (ワン・フォー・オール Wan Fō Ōru?):</b> Transferred to him by Izuku, One for All allowed Katsuki to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, allowing him to significantly enhance all of his physical abilities to a superhuman level. This resulted in unbelievable levels of strength, speed, agility, and durability. It also provided an exceptional strength boost to his given Quirk, Explosion.
      </p>

      <p>
      At the end of his and Izuku's fight against Nine, Katsuki lost One for All and the Quirk remained in Izuku's body. Toshinori initially suspected that Izuku kept One For All because Katsuki lost consciousness prior to the transfer's completion, but later theorized that the Quirk kept itself inside of Izuku due to his willingness to protect others, even if it meant losing One For All.
      </p>

      <h4>Super Moves</h4>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Explosive Speed (爆ばく速そくターボ Bakusoku Tābo):</b> Katsuki throws his hands back and uses explosions to propel himself. He uses this both on the ground to increase his speed and through the air to achieve a pseudo form of flight. He first used this technique on the ground during the Quirk Apprehension Test. The first time he used it to fly was during the Obstacle Race.</li>
      <li><b>Stun Grenade (閃光弾スタン グレネード Sutan Gurenēdo):</b> Katsuki starts by creating a sphere of light between his hands that explodes into a large scale flash. Similar to the effect of an actual stun grenade, the flash of light blinds anyone close by. He first used this technique to defeat Fumikage Tokoyami.</li>
      <li><b>Point-Blank Stun Grenade (ゼロ距きょ離り閃光弾スタングレネード Zero Kyori Sutan Gurenēdo?):</b> A variation where Katsuki fires off his Stun Grenade at point-blank range of the opponent to immediately stun and immobilize them with little lasting damage.[21] This variation was first used against Setsuna in the fourth round of the Joint Training Battle.</li>
      <li><b>Howitzer Impact (榴弾砲着弾 - ハウザー インパクト Hauzā Inpakuto?):</b> This move is the strongest move in Katsuki's arsenal, which involves Katsuki taking to the air, and then using explosions to propel himself in a circular motion to create a tornado. This tornado builds up oxygen to fuel the incoming explosion. After colliding with the target, Katsuki releases the powerful aforementioned explosion. Present Mic compared the effectiveness of the technique to that of an actual missile. Katsuki first used Howitzer Impact in the final match of the U.A. Sports Festival Finals. He has also shown that he can release the fueled explosion in midair, without having to make contact with the target. </li>
      <li><b>AP Shot (徹甲弾 - A・P・ショット Ē-Pī Shotto):</b> Katsuki stretches out one of his hands and uses his other hand to form a circle on the palm of his outstretched hand. Katsuki then fires an explosion through the circle, which creates a concentrated blast beam. By focusing the path of his explosions into a single point instead of around his whole palm, Katsuki creates a concentrated blast with reduced area of impact, but with enough power to successfully pierce solid concrete.</li>
      <ul>
      <li><b>AP Shot: Auto-Cannon (徹甲弾A・P・ショット機関銃オートカノン Ē-Pī Shotto Ōtokanon):</b> A rapid-fire version of his AP Shot Technique. The explosion power is reduced in order to avoid dealing severe damage to human targets. This variation was first used against Seiji Shishikura in the first stage of the Provisional Hero License Exam.</li>
      <ul>
      <li><b>AP Machine-Gun (徹甲機銃A・P・マシンガン Ē-Pī Mashingan):</b> A stronger version of his AP Shot: Auto-Cannon where Katsuki fires larger, rapid-fire explosions.This technique was first used against Tomura in the Paranormal Liberation War Arc.</li>
      </ul>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Explode-A-Pult (爆破式エクスカタパルト Ekusu Kataparuto):</b> While in mid-air, Katsuki grabs an opponent with one of his arms, then propels himself in a spinning motion by firing explosions with his free arm. Once he gains enough momentum, Katsuki forcefully throws his opponent with the aid of another explosion. He first used this technique against Togaru Kamakiri in the fourth round of the Joint Training Battle.</li>
      <li><b>Land Mine Blast (爆ばく風ふう地じ雷らい Bakufū Jirai):</b> Katsuki places his Grenadier Bracer on the ground and lets of a massive explosion into the ground, blowing back any obstacles surrounding him. This technique was first used to dissipate Mahoro Shimano's Hologram .</li>
      <li><b>Blasting Speed Turbo: Cluster (爆ばく速そくターボ クラスター Bakusoku Tābo Kurasutā):</b> Just like with his Explosive Speed, Katsuki uses his explosions to propel himself forward, only this time, condensing them to become stronger and faster, allowing him to unleash a flurry of bursts that blast him forward at blinding speeds. This was first inadvertently used to save Izuku from Tomura and All For One.</li>
      <li><b>One For All: Full Cowl - 100% (ワン・フォー・オール フルカウル 100%パーセント Wan Fō Ōru Furu Kauru Hyaku Pāsento):</b> Katsuki activates One For All to its fullest extent throughout Full Cowl, granting him a tremendous boost in speed and strength. Katsuki's first and only use of this technique was against Nine to defend Nabu Island. The power increase caused orange energy to trail out of Katsuki's eyes and his pupils and irises to distort. His hair also became spikier, and his entire body glowed a yellowish hue with orange electricity crackling around it. When fused with Explosion, Katsuki's original Quirk became so powerful that standard blasts from it could create enormous craters. The temperature of the explosions also increased to the point where it could melt through solid rock in a similar manner to lava as Katsuki came into close proximity to it.</li>
      <li><b>Detroit Smash (デトロイトスマッシュ Detoroito Sumasshu):</b> While he temporarily shared One For All with Izuku Midoriya and activated One For All: Full Cowl - 100%, he used this move for the first and last time with him to destroy Nine's massive fire tornado. He used his left arm while Izuku used his right, and they punched upwards to the sky, where a powerful gush of air destroyed the tornado through its eye, blowing it up.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Trivia</h2>
    <div class = "p">
      <ul>
        <li>Originally, Katsuki was a very kind and gentle character who spoke without thinking and unintentionally insulted others.
