          <p>
            A manga series serialized by Shonen Jump and written by Kohei Horikoshi. The series has been adapted into an anime series and three movies, as well as multiple spinoffs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story is set in the modern-day, except people with special powers called "Quirks" have become commonplace throughout the world. In a world of chaos and confusion, Pro Heroes have now risen as the new profession to fight off powerful super villains.
          </p>
          <p>
            A young boy named Izuku Midoriya is Quirkless, meaning he has no powers, but he still dreams of becoming a great hero one day.
